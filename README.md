# Weather Web Application 

This project was created first using React.js but migrated to Next.JS and ultiziing mainly tailwindcss for it's visual. This project uses Tomorrow.io API to provides realtime weather forecast data to the location the user input. This web application provides the current Location name, Temperature and weather codition on the top section of the website, 24 hours weather forecast on the middle section, and finally a 7 days forecast of on the bottom section.

## Limits

Since I am using a free plan for Tomorrow.io API service, there can only be 20 calls to the API service every 1 hour, so I added in example data to demonstrate the web application capability incase there are no more usage for that hour. 

Originally wanted to have a backend server running to call for the API but since I am new to deploying project on vercel, I didn't know how to get it to work.
